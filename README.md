# PASS-COMP-10001
This repository contains sample problems and work to facilitate the learning for students enrolled in COMP 10001 at Mohawk College.

Each of the folders is the date of a specific PASS Session and the code I worked on with the students who joined that session. Some of it may appear vague if you were not present, but I included comments to make it as clear as possible for anyone to look at. I hope that these resources help with your COMP 10001 Programming Fundamentals journey.

Happy studying, folks!
